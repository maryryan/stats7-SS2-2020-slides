# Studies

- The goal is to explore an association or relationship between two variables

   - There may be a relationship or there may not!
   
- How do we assess whether there is a relationship?

   - Shape (line, curve, mass of points)
   
   - Direction (positive, negative, horizontal, vertical)

   - Outliers?

# Correlation

- .alert[**Correlation, R**], tries to quantify the .alert2[**strength**] and .alert2[**direction**] of a .alert2[**linear**] relationship between two variables

.content-box-gray[
$$R = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$
]

--

- Takes on values from -1 to 1 (unitless)
   
   - R = 0 means the variables have no linear relationship
   
   - R = 1 means the variables have a perfect, .alert2[**positive**] linear relationship
   
      - If X increases by 1 unit, Y increases by 1 unit as well
   
   - R = -1 means the variables have a perfect, .alert2[**negative**] linear relationship
   
      - If X increases by 1 unit, Y decreases by 1 unit

# Correlation

- R only measures the .alert2[**linear**] relationship between two variables

   - Two variables could be perfectly related in a non-linear way and have an R near 0
   
--

- Just because two variables *seems* related, does not mean changes in one *cause* changes in the other
   
.content-box-pink[
<div style="text-align:center">Correlation does not equal causation!</div>
]

# Correlation doesn't equal causation example

---

# Linear Regression

- Knowing there *is* a linear relationship is great, but I want to know *how* two variables are related

--

- .alert[**Linear regression**] is like finding the line of best fit

.content-box-teal[
$$y = mx+b$$
$$\Rightarrow y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$
]

- $\beta_0$ is the .alert[**intercept**]
   
   - What we would expect *y* to be if *x* = 0
   
   - Doesn't always have a logical real-world interpretation
   
- $\beta_1$ is the .alert[**slope**]
   
   - How much we expect *y* to change by if we increase *x* by 1 unit
   
   - Usually what we're most intereseted in
   
---

# Regression

- What makes our regression line the "best fit"?

   - It's the line that minimizes the .alert2[**sum of squared residuals**]
   
- A .alert[**residual**], $e_i$, is the distance between an observed data point, and what our line would predict it to be

.pull-left[
.content-box-teal[
$$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$
]

- Squaring the residuals makes sure positive and negative residuals don't cancel each other out
]

.pull-right[
```{r residual plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
xy.lm <- lm(y~x, data=xy.df)
xy.df <- xy.df %>%

# $R^2$

- How can we tell whether our regression model is good?

   - Regression gives us the "best fit" line, but is "best" actually good?
   
- $R^2$ quantifies how much .alert2[**variation**] in our response is explained by our explanatory variable

   - If our explanatory variable explains most of the variation in our response, then our regression model is probably pretty good at predicting what the response will do
   
   - If our explanatory variable explains little of the variation in our response, then it will not do a good job of predicting what the response will do

# Multiple Regression

- In the real world, one explanatory variable is rarely the sole explanation for how the response variable acts

- .alert[**Multiple regression**] is an extension of simple linear regression, but instead of one explanatory variable we may have two or more

   - Still have one explanatory .alert2[**variable of interest**] that we care most about how it interacts with the response variable
   
   - Other explanatory variables in the regression are then known as .alert2[**adjustment variables**], or variables that we know are related to the response variable in some way
   
---

# Types of Adjustment Variables

- .alert[**Confounding variables**]

   - Related to both the explanatory variable of interest and the response variable
   
   - Including these in the model will adjust for this variable’s confounding effect and .alert2[**isolate**] the effect of the explanatory variable of interest
   
![confounding variable diagram](/Users/maryryan/Desktop/teaching-classes/stats7-SS2-2020/stats7-SS2-2020-slides/stats7-SS2-2020-regression/confounder.png)

---

# Types of Adjustment Variables

- .alert[**Precision variables**]

   - Just related to the response variable
   
   - Including these in a regression will make our model .alert2[**more accurate**] and give us more specific effects of the explanatory variable of interest on the response

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7)

What else might be related to the number of runs a team scores as well as the number of players they send to bat?

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7)

What else might be related to the number of runs a team scores as well as the number of players they send to bat?

- Batting average?
   - Teams with a higher batting average will probably score more runs
   - A low batting average would mean players are frequently struck out, which means less opportunity for players to bat (if 3 players strike out, the teams switch places)
  
--
 
- Home runs?
   - Teams with more home runs score more runs
   - Teams with more home runs might mean fewer strike outs, which means more opportunities for players to bat
   
--

- Wins?
   - Teams who scored more runs will have more wins
   - Don't say much about at-bats...

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7)

Adjusted Model:

- Runs = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$(at-bats) + $\beta_2$(batting avg) + $\beta_3$(homeruns)

```{r MLBmulti, echo=FALSE}
mlb.lm.multi <- summary(lm(runs ~ at_bats + bat_avg + homeruns, data=mlb11))

```

--

- Runs = `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[1,1],4)` + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[2,1],4)`(at-bats) + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[3,1],4)`(batting avg) + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[4,1],4)`(homeruns)

.alert2[**For every 1 extra player a team sends to bat during a season, their total runs**] .alert[**decrease**] .alert2[**by `r -round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[2,1], 4)`, on average.**]

--

Old Model:

- Runs = `r round(mlb.lm$coef[1,1],4)` + .alert[`r round(mlb.lm$coef[2,1],4)`](at-bats)

# Example: Video Game Ratings (pt. 6)

What else might be related to a game's rating score, as well as the completion time?

# Example: Video Game Ratings (pt. 6)

What else might be related to a game's rating score, as well as the completion time?

- Genre?

- ESRB Rating?

# Example: Video Game Ratings (pt. 6)

Adjusted Model:

- Review Score = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$(Median time to completion) + $\beta_2$(ESRB rating)

```{r VGmulti, echo=FALSE}
vg.lm.multi <- summary(lm(metrics_review_score ~ length_all_play_styles_median + release_rating, data=video_games))

```

--

- Review Score = `r round(vg.lm.multi$coef[1,1],4)` + `r round(vg.lm.multi$coef[2,1],4)`(Median time to completiton) `r round(vg.lm.multi$coef[3,1],4)`(ESRB rating = T) `r round(vg.lm.multi$coef[4,1],4)`(ESRB rating = M)

.alert2[**When the median completion time increases by 1 hour, a game's rating increases by `r round(vg.lm.multi$coef[2,1], 4)`, on average.**]

Old Model:

- Review Score = `r round(vg.lm$coef[1,1],4)` + .alert[`r round(vg.lm$coef[2,1],4)`](Median time to completion)
