# Learning Objectives

By the end of today's lecture you should be able to:

- understand how to describe the relationship between two variables

- interpret the intercept and slope(s) of a regression model

- diagnose the appropriateness of a regression model

---

# Why Do We Perform Studies?

- The goal is to explore an association or relationship between two variables

   - There may be a relationship or there may not!
   
- How do we assess whether there is a relationship?

---

# Review: Scatterplots

.pull-left[
- Used to .alert2[**visualize**] relationship between 2 variables

- .alert[**Explanatory/Indendent variable**] goes on x-axis

- .alert[**Dependent variable/response**] goes on y-axis

- .alert2[**Are x and y related?**]

   - Shape (line, curve, mass of points)
   
   - Direction (positive, negative, horizontal, vertical)
   
   - Strength (defined/tight or scattered)
   
   - Outliers?

]

.pull-right[
```{r scatterplot exp, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

# Correlation

- .alert[**Correlation, R**], tries to quantify the .alert2[**strength**] and .alert2[**direction**] of a .alert2[**linear**] relationship between two variables

.content-box-gray[
$$R = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$
]

--

- Takes on values from -1 to 1 (unitless)
   
   - R = 0 means the variables have no linear relationship
   
   - R = 1 means the variables have a perfect, .alert2[**positive**] linear relationship
   
      - If X increases by 1 unit, Y increases by 1 unit as well
   
   - R = -1 means the variables have a perfect, .alert2[**negative**] linear relationship
   
      - If X increases by 1 unit, Y decreases by 1 unit

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 2)
Is the number of times a team has a player go up to bat throughout a season (called .alert2[**"at-bats"**]) related to the number of .alert2[**runs**] that teams scores?

```{r mlbPlot2, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
mlb.corr <- cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)

mlb11.p.lab <- mlb11.p + 
   geom_label(aes(x=5460, y=825, label=paste("R=", round(mlb.corr, 4))), size=6)

mlb11.p.lab
```

# Example: Star Wars (pt. 2)

Is the .alert2[**height**] of a character related to that character's .alert2[**mass**]?

```{r starWarsPlot2, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
sw.corr <- cor(starwars$mass, starwars$height)
starwars.p.lab <- starwars.p + 
   geom_label(aes(x=100, y=1000, label=paste("R=", round(sw.corr, 4))), size=6)

starwars.p.lab

```

---

# Correlation

- R only measures the .alert2[**linear**] relationship between two variables

   - Two variables could be perfectly related in a non-linear way and have an R near 0
   
--

- Just because two variables *seems* related, does not mean changes in one *cause* changes in the other

# Linear Regression

- Knowing there *is* a linear relationship is great, but I want to know *how* two variables are related

--

- .alert[**Linear regression**] is like finding the line of best fit

.content-box-teal[
$$y = mx+b$$
$$\Rightarrow y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$
]

- $\beta_0$ is the .alert[**intercept**]
   
   - What we would expect *y* to be if *x* = 0
   
   - Doesn't always have a logical real-world interpretation
   
- $\beta_1$ is the .alert[**slope**]
   
   - How much we expect *y* to change by if we increase *x* by 1 unit
   
   - Usually what we're most intereseted in
   
---

# Regression

- What makes our regression line the "best fit"?

   - It's the line that minimizes the .alert2[**sum of squared residuals**]
   
- A .alert[**residual**], $e_i$, is the distance between an observed data point, and what our line would predict it to be

.pull-left[
.content-box-teal[
$$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$
]

- Squaring the residuals makes sure positive and negative residuals don't cancel each other out
]

.pull-right[
```{r residual plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE}
xy.lm <- lm(y~x, data=xy.df)
xy.df <- xy.df %>% 
   mutate(fitted = fitted(xy.lm),
          residual = round(residuals(xy.lm), 3))

xy.df %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y))+
   geom_point(size=4)+
   ggtitle("Scatterplot")+
   xlab("Explanatory (Independent) Variable")+
   ylab("Dependent Variable (Response)")+
   geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)+
   geom_segment(aes(x = x, y = y,
                   xend = x, yend = fitted, color="red"))+
   #geom_label(aes(label=residual, x=x, y=fitted + 0.5*residual, color="red"))+
   theme(axis.title = element_text(size=18),
         axis.text = element_text(size=14),
         title = element_text(size=20),
         legend.position = "none")
```
]

---

# Regression

In this class we won't be calculating the intercept and slope by hand, but it's important to know these values don't come out of thin air: we estimate them through the data.

.content-box-gray[
$$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} + \hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$
$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$
]

---

# Conditions for Linear Regression

**There are 4 conditions we need to meet for linear regression to be appropriate. If we fail to meet one (or multiple) of these conditions, the reported relationship between X and Y from the regression might be biased from the truth** 

<div style="position:fixed; top:450px; right:400px">   
   <img src="./non-constant-variability-reg.png" alt="an example of non-constant variability, where the data points at the left part of the plot fit closely to the regression line, and the data points at the right part of the plot fit less closely to the regression line, creating a "fan" effect." width="200px"/>
</div>

1. .alert[**Linearity**]

   - Linear regression models the linear relationship between variables, so the data should look like some sort of linear relationship exists

2. .alert[**Roughly "bell-curve" residuals**]

   - If you make histogram of the residuals, it should look like a bell curve (symmetric, unimodal)

3. .alert[**Constant variability**]

   - The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant
      - Example of non-constant variability:
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>

4. .alert[**Independent observations**]
   
   - No observation should influence the values of other observations

# $R^2$

- How can we tell whether our regression model is good?

   - Regression gives us the "best fit" line, but is "best" actually good?
   
- $R^2$ quantifies how much .alert2[**variation**] in our response is explained by our explanatory variable

   - If our explanatory variable explains most of the variation in our response, then our regression model is probably pretty good at predicting what the response will do
   
   - If our explanatory variable explains little of the variation in our response, then it will not do a good job of predicting what the response will do

# Multiple Regression

- In the real world, one explanatory variable is rarely the sole explanation for how the response variable acts

- .alert[**Multiple regression**] is an extension of simple linear regression, but instead of one explanatory variable we may have two or more

   - Still have one explanatory .alert2[**variable of interest**] that we care most about how it interacts with the response variable
   
   - Other explanatory variables in the regression are then known as .alert2[**adjustment variables**], or variables that we know are related to the response variable in some way
   
---

# Types of Adjustment Variables

- .alert[**Confounding variables**]

   - Related to both the explanatory variable of interest and the response variable
   
   - Including these in the model will adjust for this variable’s confounding effect and .alert2[**isolate**] the effect of the explanatory variable of interest
   
![confounding variable diagram](confounder.png)

---

# Types of Adjustment Variables

- .alert[**Precision variables**]

   - Just related to the response variable
   
   - Including these in a regression will make our model .alert2[**more accurate**] and give us more specific effects of the explanatory variable of interest on the response

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7)

What else might be related to the number of runs a team scores as well as the number of players they send to bat?

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7)

What else might be related to the number of runs a team scores as well as the number of players they send to bat?

- Batting average?
   - Teams with a higher batting average will probably score more runs
   - A low batting average would mean players are frequently struck out, which means less opportunity for players to bat (if 3 players strike out, the teams switch places)
  
--
 
- Home runs?
   - Teams with more home runs score more runs
   - Teams with more home runs might mean fewer strike outs, which means more opportunities for players to bat
   
--

- Wins?
   - Teams who scored more runs will have more wins
   - Don't say much about at-bats...

# Example: MLB 2011 (pt. 7.1)

Adjusted Model:

- Runs = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$(at-bats) + $\beta_2$(batting avg) + $\beta_3$(homeruns)

```{r MLBmulti, echo=FALSE}
mlb.lm.multi <- summary(lm(runs ~ at_bats + bat_avg + homeruns, data=mlb11))

```

- Runs = `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[1,1],4)` + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[2,1],4)`(at-bats) + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[3,1],4)`(batting avg) + `r round(mlb.lm.multi$coef[4,1],4)`(homeruns)

# Adjusted $R^2$

- With simple regression, we assessed how good our model was with $R^2$.

- In multiple regression, we use .alert[**adjusted $R^2$**]
   
   - Adjusted $R^2$ adds an extra term that helps adjust it for multiple variables being in the model
   
- We interpret it in a similar way:
   
.content-box-teal[
.center[
"All the variables in the model explain $(R^2 \times 100)$% of the variation in response variable *y*"
